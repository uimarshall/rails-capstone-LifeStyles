def create
    if current_user.votes.exists?(article_id: params[:article_id])
      flash[:alert] = 'You have already voted for this article!'
    else
      current_user.votes_count << Article.find(params[:article_id])
      flash[:notice] = 'You upvoted this article.'
    end
    redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path)
  end

  I had to add has_many :votes_count, through: :votes, source: :article
  rails g scaffold Category name:string priority:integer
  git remote rm heroku # to remove already deployed app so as to deploy new one
  heroku login
  heroku create
  heroku apps:rename entrelab

  bundle install --without production
  git push heroku develop:master
